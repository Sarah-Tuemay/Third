        <h2>Ancient Origins and Domestication</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Fact 1:</b> Dogs are descended from wolves. While the exact timeline is still debated, genetic evidence suggests the domestication of dogs from wolves occurred tens of thousands of years ago, potentially even before the development of agriculture. This makes them one of the oldest domesticated animals.   </p>
            <p>
                <b>Fact 2:</b> The exact reason for this partnership remains a topic of scientific discussion. Some theories propose that wolves with less fear of humans were more likely to scavenge from human settlements, leading to a gradual process of natural selection. Others suggest a more collaborative relationship where humans and wolves hunted together.   
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Fact 3:</b> Early dogs likely played a variety of roles in human societies, from hunting and guarding to providing warmth and companionship. Evidence of early dog burials alongside humans suggests a deep emotional connection existed between our species even in prehistoric times.  
            </p>
            <h2>Breed Diversity: A Testament to Adaptation</h2>
            <b>Fact 4:</b> The sheer diversity of dog breeds is astonishing. From the tiny Chihuahua to the massive Great Dane, there are hundreds of recognized breeds, each with its own unique characteristics, temperament, and purpose.</p>
            <b>Fact 5:</b> This incredible variety is a result of selective breeding. Humans have intentionally bred dogs for specific traits, whether it be herding ability, speed, scent detection, or simply companionship.</p>
            <b>Fact 6:</b> While purebred dogs can be predictable in terms of appearance and temperament, mixed-breed dogs, often called mutts, can inherit a delightful combination of traits from their various ancestors. They often have fewer health problems due to their wider gene pool.</p>
