        <h2>Sensory Superpowers:</h2>
        <p>
            Fact 7: Dogs have an extraordinary sense of smell. Their noses are estimated to be thousands of times more sensitive than ours. They can detect scents we can't even imagine, which is why they are used for everything from finding drugs and explosives to detecting medical conditions.
            <p>
                Fact 8: A dog's sense of smell is so acute that they can even detect changes in human body chemistry, such as those associated with certain diseases like cancer or changes in blood sugar levels. This has led to the development of dogs trained to provide medical alerts.
            </p>

            <p>
                Fact 9: While their sense of smell is exceptional, a dog's vision is different from ours. They have dichromatic vision, meaning they see in shades of blue and yellow, rather than the full spectrum of colors that humans perceive.
            </p>

            <p>
                Fact 10: Dogs also have excellent hearing. They can hear sounds at much higher frequencies than humans, and their ears can rotate independently to pinpoint the source of a sound.
            </p>

            <h2>Communication: Beyond the Bark:</h2>
            <p>
                Fact 11: Dogs communicate in a variety of ways, not just through barking. Body language, including tail wags, ear position, facial expressions, and posture, plays a crucial role in their communication.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Fact 12: A wagging tail doesn't always mean a happy dog. The speed and direction of the wag can convey different emotions, from excitement to anxiety.
